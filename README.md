Based on [this](http://pastebin.com/vH9phDJJ) program by **/u/stirante** from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/xposed/comments/4cb1g3/request_xposed_download_button_for_soundcloud/) Reddit thread.
Few minor changes to improve stability.

## Installation & Usage
Simply install the application and enable the module in Xposed (and reboot). Clicking the triple-dot menu next to a track (or on the track page) should show a download option. All downloads are saved to `/sdcard/Download` by default.
